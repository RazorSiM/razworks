>Most people know that I'm a topre lover, I don't deny it, I always wanted to make a set that would be a direct tribute to a topre keyboard/keyset.That said, there was always 1 specific topre keyboard that I loved, the norbaforce owned by nmur. I asked his permission on that, and he was keen to let me use his very personnal colorway to make this particular GMK set! I decided to tweak it a bit to make it more "modern" by having icon mods and more flashy colors instead of the standard RGB Desko look.
