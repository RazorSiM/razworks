# ePBT Grand Tour by FEDEMITO

*I am not the GB Runner here! They commissioned me some renders and mousepads designs! Below will be ONLY my renders/designs, nothing else*

Link to the IC on Geekhack [here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=108068.0), link to the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/5RcuT2c).

I joined forces with my friend [Fedemito](https://www.instagram.com/fedemito_/) to deliver some good renders and kits for this set!

Inspired by a poster (I love it) that my best friends gave to me for my birthday a couple of years ago.
![NASA Artwork](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/visions-of-the-future/images/grand_tour.jpg)

The poster itself is from NASA/JPL.
The Grand Tour is the route the Voyager 2 spacecraft took to visit all four outer planets. It's a flight plan that's possible every 175 years for the alignment of the outer planets of our solar system.

My friend Alessandro Maranta worked on the novelties design and he made a great job.
