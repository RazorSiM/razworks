# New Website section and changes

Hey boys, I've made an [Updates section](https://raz.works/updates) where you'll find all the **changelogs** and **info** about the **projects** I follow. 

About the website changes:
 - Polished the design so it's better looking;
 - Changes to the Theme generator: now I only use 4 colors plus foreground and backgrounds from the base16 themes you can pick
 - Images should have smaller sizes now but I'm not entirely sure. Got to investigate more.
 

 ToDo:
  - A bot to post updates to the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Mn2Ty3y)
  - A small sidebar changelog thing that tracks commits and improvements, maybe.
